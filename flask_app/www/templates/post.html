        <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having
          the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center
          because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if
          free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
